# sponge-thesis-sw
software for an agent-based model simulating the symbiotic relationship between sponge/coral hosts and algal symbionts

Authors: Rebecca Anderson, Barry Lawson

This work continued to develop and update software developed by Lawson et al. Changes included expansion of the simulation's modeling of the sponge host environment (allowing for both 2D and 3D grids + square and hexagonal host cells), addition of a function to write out the (x,y,z) locations of symbionts throughout simulated time to allow for 3D visualization of the host, and the extension of the model to allow multiple symbionts per host cell. More detailed information can be found in my thesis.
